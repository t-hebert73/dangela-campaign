                <h1>Political Experience</h1>

                <p>
                    Henry has long believed he could make a difference by taking an active role in municipal governance.  At the age of 31, he won his first electoral victory – becoming a member of the Thorold Hydro Electric Commission for the 1997-2000 term. As Transition Steering Committee Chair, Henry helped guide the change to the current hydro service provider, resulting in the sale of $17.1 million worth of Thorold Hydro assets that now are held by the City for all its citizens.

                    Henry ran successfully for City Council in 2000 and expanded his experience to include numerous committees that benefit the residents of Thorold such as the Downtown Redevelopment Task Force, Thorold Non-Profit Housing Corporation, Thorold Festival Committee and the Sports Advisory Committee.
