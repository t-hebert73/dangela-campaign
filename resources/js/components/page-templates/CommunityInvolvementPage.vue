                <h1>Community Involvement</h1>

                <p>
                    Being part of a community means more than just calling Thorold “home”.  For Henry being a real part of Thorold means giving back to the people who helped raise and influence you.  It means sharing your neighbours’ burdens, joys, sorrows and successes.  It means serving your fellow citizens in ways that benefit the whole community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For Henry service is a way of life, and Thorold is a better place because of his strong sense of community.
